# YouTube Live Plugin Development Session

## Implemented Features

### Background Task Architecture
- **Two separate background tasks** using `tokio::spawn` for non-blocking operation:
  - **Metrics polling task**: Polls YouTube API for video statistics (views, likes, dislikes, live viewers)
  - **Chat monitoring task**: Real-time processing of live chat messages, super chats, and sponsorships
- **Coordination via `tokio::watch`**: Both tasks coordinate stream selection changes through watch channels
- **Non-blocking design**: Chat processing is never blocked by metrics API calls

### Stream Selection Optimization
- **Structured coordination**: Replaced tuple-based coordination with `StreamSelection` struct:
  ```rust
  struct StreamSelection {
      channel_id: Option<String>,
      broadcast_id: Option<String>, 
      live_chat_id: Option<String>,
  }
  ```
- **Live chat ID pre-fetching**: Extract live chat ID directly from broadcast data during stream selection
- **Eliminated redundant API calls**: No longer need separate `get_live_chat_id` helper function
- **Optimized chat startup**: Chat monitoring starts immediately when live chat ID is available

### API Efficiency Improvements  
- **Direct broadcast data access**: Get live chat ID from `broadcast.snippet.live_chat_id` during broadcast iteration
- **Fallback mechanism**: Still supports manually selected broadcasts via video statistics API when needed
- **Reduced quota usage**: Saves API quota by avoiding unnecessary video statistics calls for chat ID lookup

### Real-time Chat Processing
- **Event-driven architecture**: Process chat messages, super chats, and sponsorships as they arrive
- **TouchPortal integration**: Trigger events and update states in real-time:
  - Chat messages with author details and timestamps
  - Super chats with amount and currency information  
  - New sponsors and membership milestones
- **Structured logging**: Comprehensive tracing for debugging and monitoring

### Dynamic Configuration Support
- **Polling interval watch channel**: Infrastructure ready for dynamic polling interval updates
- **Setting change preparation**: `polling_interval_tx` watch sender ready for when SDK supports setting callbacks

## Technical Architecture

### Plugin Structure
```rust
struct Plugin {
    yt: HashMap<String, Channel>,
    tp: TouchPortalHandle,
    current_channel: Option<String>,
    current_broadcast: Option<String>,
    stream_selection_tx: watch::Sender<StreamSelection>,
    polling_interval_tx: watch::Sender<u64>, // TODO: Use when SDK supports setting changes
}
```

### Background Task Coordination
- **Metrics polling**: Configurable interval (minimum 30 seconds), respects API quotas
- **Chat monitoring**: Real-time processing with immediate responsiveness
- **Stream changes**: Both tasks react instantly to stream selection changes
- **Error handling**: Proper error contexts and fallback mechanisms throughout

### TouchPortal Integration
- **4 Settings**: OAuth tokens, polling interval, channel/broadcast persistence
- **6 States**: Live metrics (likes, dislikes, views, live viewers, stream title, channel name) 
- **4 Action Categories**: Account management, stream selection, stream control, chat events
- **Rich Events**: Chat messages, super chats, and sponsorships with local state data

## Known Limitations & TODOs

### Setting Change Reactivity
- **Current**: Polling interval changes require plugin restart
- **TODO**: Add setting change callbacks when TouchPortal SDK supports them
- **Ready**: Infrastructure (`polling_interval_tx` watch channel) already in place

### Manual Broadcast Selection
- **Current**: Manually selected broadcasts use fallback video statistics API for live chat ID
- **Impact**: Slightly less efficient than "latest broadcast" selection
- **Acceptable**: Still functional and only affects manually selected older broadcasts

## Performance Characteristics

### API Efficiency
- **Stream selection**: 1 API call to list broadcasts (gets both broadcast ID and live chat ID)
- **Metrics polling**: 1 API call per interval for video statistics
- **Chat monitoring**: Continuous streaming connection (minimal overhead)
- **Total quota usage**: Significantly reduced compared to previous implementation

### Responsiveness
- **Chat events**: Processed immediately as they arrive from YouTube
- **Stream changes**: Both background tasks react within milliseconds
- **UI updates**: TouchPortal states and events updated in real-time
- **Error recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

## Development Quality

### Code Organization
- **Literate programming**: Clear section comments explaining the "why" not just "what"
- **Type safety**: Structured data types instead of anonymous tuples
- **Error handling**: Consistent use of `eyre::Context` for error chains
- **Logging**: Structured tracing throughout for debugging and monitoring

### Testing & Reliability
- **Compilation**: All code compiles successfully without errors
- **Type safety**: Leverages Rust's type system to prevent runtime errors
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues functioning even when some API calls fail
- **Resource cleanup**: Proper cleanup of chat streams when switching broadcasts

This implementation provides a robust, efficient, and maintainable YouTube Live integration for TouchPortal with real-time chat processing and optimized API usage.
