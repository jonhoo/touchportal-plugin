# Session Notes

This file tracks bugs, oddities, missing features, and other
observations that are discovered while working, but can be deferred
until later rather than implemented straight-away. It should be used to
record incidental features/issues you encounter that can be left to fix
later so you don't get distracted. Don't dump your entire TODO list in
this file!
